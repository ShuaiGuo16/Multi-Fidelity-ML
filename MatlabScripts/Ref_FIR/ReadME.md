Run **FIR_Komarek.m** to plot the reference FTF

Run **Modify_FIR.m** to create *modelPSD_v2.m* model. This impulse response model contains both the flame FIR model as well as a noise FIR filter representing the turbulent combustion noise. This model can be directly integrated into the taX network model.
