function MU = msns_m_d
%
%  Deletes the global data that has been generated by 'msns_m_i'.
%
%  Calling sequence:
%
%    msns_m_d 
%    MU = msns_m_d
% 
%  Output:
%
%    MU        Cholesky factor of M
%
%  MU is returned just in case the Cholesky factor MU is needed for some 
%  reason after the computation is done, but has been deleted to save memory.
